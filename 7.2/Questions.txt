What is the advantage of using finally if just placing code after the try/except blocks
can accomplish the same thing?

I came across material that suggested that 'assert' isn't really used 'in production' because it causes your program to crash. Does this mean assertions are mainly used during development mode and then are changed over to try/except blocks for production mode programs?
